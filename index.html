<p>Life Tap is an app dedicated to save the lives of stray animals just a bit of info and
and a click is enough to save a life and i feel sad when some people do not help the 
stray animals and they just shoo them away or haraz the animals by either throwing rocks at them or
by hitting them with something so i wanna help them even a bit by giving them food and water
so i made this website. Im not forcing you but if you can donate some money to save a life...</p>
